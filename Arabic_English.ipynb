Due to the non-transparent shareholding structure, the Hong Kong authorities refused to list the company.

According to the same source, the sole purpose of many founders of technology start-ups is to create attractive products or services for venture capital investors. In other words, it tries to maximize market value without worrying too much about the intrinsic ability of the business to generate long-term value.

Analysts believe that this program will have no effect because most companies are over-indebted, so they have a very low appetite to borrow new money, albeit at very low cost. Another sign that any hope of a return is in vain is the fact that, although the authorities have become more relaxed about the ratio between loans and deposits (a sacred thing in Chinese banking), the economy remains in place. The real estate collapse, generated by a housing supply disproportionate to demand, is another danger facing the country led by the current leader, Xi Jinping.

Today, American brokers have massively bought shares in an appliance company, believing it to be a popular social networking platform. The price of a Tweeter stock has risen from less than a penny to 15 cents, and Friday's stock market session has been the busiest for the company in six years since it went bankrupt. More than 11.7 million Tweeter shares were traded today. The last active day for the company was May 10, 2007, when it published its quarterly results and announced that it would most likely go into insolvency and come under special administration. Even after the brokers realized the confusion and sold the securities they bought, the company closed the trading session with a quotation of five cents per security, ie an increase of 699% compared to the previous day. The episode was fueled by the news that was circulating today about Twitter, which announced that it had even chosen the symbol (ticker) with which the shares will be traded on the stock exchange. The company's initial public offering of shares is the most anticipated on international stock exchanges in the last year. The company's representatives submitted all the necessary documents for listing on the stock exchanges on Thursday, but the date on which the shares of the socialization platform will be traded is not yet known.\n",
