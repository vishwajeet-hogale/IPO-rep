Already this year, Bombora-backed pet services marketplace Mad Paws locked in $12 million for its IPO, in an ASX debut valuing it at $42.9 million market capitalisation. That deal was handled by brokers Foster Stockbroking and CCZ Statton Equities, and came as Seattle-based online pet sitting marketplace Rover – a similar business offshore – signed its own $US1.35 billion deal.Up next is Switzerland-headquartered artificial intelligence company NVISO, which closed a $5 million pre-IPO round late last year. It is understood Taylor Collison had been drafted in to handle that float.Then there’s flight simulator technology company Orbx – which also tapped the market in late 2020, this time in a $10 million pre-IPO round and has lined up Wilsons for its run at the ASX boards later this year. It’ll be out pitching its flight simulation games and scenery packages, which are used by flight simulation makers to sell to their own customers.","the money manager has five early-stage investments positioning for the local bourse this year. the deal was handled by Foster Stockbroking and CCZ Statton Equities, and came as Seattle-based online pet sitting marketplace Rover signed its own $US1.35 billion deal.Up next is Switzerland-headquartered artificial intelligence company NVISO, which closed a $5 million pre-IPO round late last year."
